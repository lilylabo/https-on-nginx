These are my supporting files and notes for
[HTTP on Nginx: From Zero To A+ (Part 1)](https://juliansimioni.com/blog/https-on-nginx-from-zero-to-a-plus-part-1/) and
[HTTP on Nginx: From Zero To A+ (Part 2) Configuration, Ciphersuites, and Performance](https://juliansimioni.com/blog/https-on-nginx-from-zero-to-a-plus-part-2-configuration-ciphersuites-and-performance/).

## Contents

* ssl.conf - a ready to go Nginx config file that can be placed in
  /etc/nginx/conf.d to quickly default to secure settings. It's heavily commented for clarity
* example-site.conf - a nearly ready to go Nginx config file for a single
  host, for the few config options that require some configuration
* references.md - A list of all the references I used writing the blog posts
